1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are develpoing in groups, the code base is easier to manage with a remote repository. It can also serve as a backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pull allows you to pull what you need to sync with your local. Automatic pull my pull in changes that are not needed at that particular point in time.
